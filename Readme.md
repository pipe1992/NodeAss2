### 1. Project design

I generated the structure adviced with a store.js in order to access it from anywhere (comments.js and posts.js) in the code, i used morgan as logger and node-dev to simplify testing and dev. 

There were no issues or challenges with this assigment

### 2. Tests

I used postman and implemented CRUD test for all the posts and comments methods, all working accordingly


### 3. Working

The project is working as intended
